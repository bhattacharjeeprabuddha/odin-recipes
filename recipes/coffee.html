    <h1>Description:</h1>
    <p>Contrary to popular opinion, French press coffee is not just for coffee snobs. But it certainly doesn't hurt to be one if you're looking to dive into this popular brewing method. French press is a simple, manual brewing method that gives you total control over your brew. Really anyone can do it, and it's one of the least expensive brewing methods available.</p>
    <p>But the French press is not without its drawbacks. Because it's a manual brewing system, you can't exactly set it and just walk away. It's also a little finicky when it comes to the grind size â€” it's recommended that you grind your own beans to achieve the uniformly coarse grind necessary for French press coffee. But once you get the hang of the process, you really will end up with delicious coffee in its simplest form.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>French press coffee maker</li>
        <li>Whole coffee beans grinder</li>
        <li>Freshly roasted coffee beans</li>
        <li>Measuring Cups or Digital Food Scale</li>
        <li>Boiling water</li>
        <li>Spoon or stirrer</li>
        <li>Timer</li>
        <li>Your favorite mug</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step to fabulous French press coffee is to warm up the press. You can do this by boiling water and rinsing out the press. This will help maintain the temperature while brewing.</li>
        <li>Next, it's time to measure and grind your coffee beans. Start by measuring your desired amount of whole coffee beans (refer to our list above for general coffee:water ratios). Use a burr grinder to grind whole coffee beans into coarse, consistently-sized grounds.</li>
        <li>Discard any hot water from the French press, and add the coffee grinds to the empty press. Bring your desired amount of water to a boil, and then allow it to cool for one minute. Pour the water into the French press.</li>
        <li>Using a long spoon or stirrer, stir vigorously to break up the top layer.</li>
        <li>Allow the coffee to steep for an additional four minutes. Once the timer goes off, gently push the plunger all the way to the bottom of the press. Serve immediately, although you can always store any leftover coffee in a thermos to keep it warm for a while longer (but not too long, as it will start to get bitter as it sits). Congratulations! You've just made French press coffee.</li>
    </ol>
